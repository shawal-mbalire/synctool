# Project Title: Secure Deduplicating Sync Tool

## Project Description

This project is a command-line utility written in C++ for backing up and synchronizing directories securely and efficiently using data deduplication. It aims to provide a robust solution for managing data backups without relying on graphical interfaces or external complex dependencies beyond standard libraries and potentially a hashing library.

## Definitions of Done (MVP)

For this project's Minimum Viable Product to be considered complete, it must meet the following criteria:

* **Core Backup/Sync:** Successfully backup a source directory to a destination repository and update existing backups efficiently by only processing changes.
* **Deduplication:** Identify and store only unique file data chunks within the repository, linked via metadata.
* **Metadata Management:** Store file structure and chunk references in the repository, sufficient to understand the backup state.
* **Integrity Check:** Provide a command to verify that all referenced data chunks exist in the repository.
* **Command-Line Usability:** All primary functions (backup/sync, check integrity) must be accessible and controllable via command-line arguments.
* **Basic Reliability:** Handle fundamental file system errors gracefully and provide informative messages.

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake as its build system.

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Create a build directory (recommended):

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project and generate build files:

    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

    *(Note: You might need to specify a generator if you're not using the default, e.g., `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..` or `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..`)*
4. Build the project:

    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

    *(This command is universal for most generators. If using Makefiles directly, you'd run `make`)*

The executable will typically be found in the `build` directory (or a subdirectory like `build/bin`).

## Usage

[Provide instructions and examples on how to use your command-line tool]

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing the built executable
cd build

# Example: Initial backup
./sync_tool backup /path/to/source /path/to/repository

# Example: Synchronize subsequent changes
./sync_tool sync /path/to/source /path/to/repository

# Example: Check integrity of repository
./sync_tool check /path/to/repository

# Example: Get help
./sync_tool --help

Development Progress

Use this section to track your progress towards the Definitions of Done. Update the checkboxes, list completed milestones, or note your current focus.

    [ ] CLI Argument Parsing: Set up command-line argument handling.

    [ ] File Traversal: Implement recursive directory traversal.
    [ ] File Chunking: Implement logic to read files and split into fixed-size chunks.
    [ ] Hashing: Integrate a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to compute chunk hashes.
    [ ] Chunk Storage: Implement logic to save unique chunks to the repository based on their hash.
    [ ] Metadata Definition: Design the format and structure for storing file metadata.
    [ ] Metadata Storage: Implement logic to save file metadata to the repository.
    [ ] Initial Backup Logic: Implement the flow for the first backup run.
    [ ] Synchronization Logic: Implement the comparison and update logic for subsequent runs.
    [ ] Integrity Check Logic: Implement the function to verify repository consistency.
    [ ] Basic Error Handling: Add checks and messages for common errors.
    [ ] Documentation: Complete basic usage instructions in the README.
